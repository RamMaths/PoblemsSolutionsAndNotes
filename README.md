# Problems, Solutions and Notes

This repo contains problems attached with their solution and some additional notes. The problems I am solving are mostly from UVA Online judge since I am basing the set of problems on the book `Competitive Programming 3 - The New Lower Bound of Programming Contests` by Steven Halim and Felix Halim.

I will be using [virtual judge](https://vjudge.net) as the platform to solve this problems. Here's the link to [my profile](https://vjudge.net/user/ramsesMata#).
